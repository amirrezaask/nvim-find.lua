# Disclaimer
You will find more feature-rich alternatives in [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim) or [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), which have seen more development time. Nvim-Finder was created primarily as a learning project for me to learn both about how to manage UIs and fast searching text in real time.
